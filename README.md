# Installation

1. Unpack or clone repository into a new directory
2. Drop all your source images into /source-images/ _(for best results, ensure each filename starts or ends with a page number, E.G. babby001.png, babby002.png, etc)_
3. Edit `config.php`, fill in your desired image sizes and quality
4. Run `process.php` from the command line to generate the images (`php process.php`)
5. Load in your browser to admire your generated catalog!

_Note: Deleting `process.php` after you've achieved the desired result is recommended for security reasons._

# Notes
